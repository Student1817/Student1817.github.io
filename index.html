        <img class= "centerimg" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/De_Havilland_Mosquitoat_night_takeoff.jpg" alt="DH.98 Mosquito, 256 Sqdrn Foggia Italy" width="60%" >
        <p class= "indenttext" class="margin">A flight of DeHavilland DH.98 Mosquitoes silently fly just above the sea carrying a bombay full of explosives through the night. Their target, enemy ships docked in little inlets between the mountains. The Mosquitoes turn tightly in formation as they race through the valleys to line up with their foggy target. As the shapes of multiple medium sized cargo ships and escorts come into view, the Mosquitoes arm their bombs. The aircraft pass swiftly over the target dropping their anti-ship bombs with precision before the enemy crew can man their positions. The detonations strike all of the cargo ships and some of their escorts, slowly sending their crew and cargo to the bottom. The Mosquitoes bank away and begin their quick and daring journey home as enemy interceptors scramble at an airfield nearby. But the Mosquitoes and their crew do not fear and ready their heavy forward air-to-air armament.</p>
        <p class= "indenttext" class="margin">A pair of Canadian CF-18 Hornets roar through the sky above the Gulf carrying a payload of 500lbs bombs. Coming up to the coast, they sight their target in the dusty hills. Though the visibility is low, the pilots' excellent navigational tools allow them to find their marks. They line up their bombsights and drop their munitions precisely on enemy artillery batteries below. The lead pilot looks behind their Hornetâ€™s wingtip vortexes to see plumes of smoke rising from the hostile position. As they bank away they are painted by hostile aircraft radar. The RWR identifies the aircraft as Mig-21s. Luckily the CF-18s are equipped to handle the task. With the flick of a switch both CF-18s switch to Air-to-Air modes and open fire.</p>
        <p class= "indenttext" class="margin">The DeHavilland Mosquito, the Wooden Wonder which would carry out some of the most daring and intricate sorties of WWII for the allied powers. Carrying bombs capable of extreme precision and destruction along with a powerful air to air armament to carry out combat air patrols. Though it may sound obvious the DeHavilland DH.98 Mosquito shares many of the same characteristics as modern multi-role aircraft and perhaps more interesting is that modern multi-role aircraft may have more in common with the Mosquito and other famous aircraft of the fighter and bomber varieties of WWII.</p>
        <p class= "indenttext" class="margin">If you are less familiar with both the DH.98 Mosquito and the CF-18 (F-18) or other modern (late Cold War) multi-role aircraft, I recommend reading the following linked pages on these various aircraft (their capabilities, background, uses, etc.).</p>
