        <p class= "indenttext">A flight of DeHavilland DH.98 Mosquitoes silently fly just above the sea carrying a bombay full of explosives through the night. Their target, enemy ships docked in little inlets between the mountains. The Mosquitoes turn tightly in formation as they race through the valleys to line up with their foggy target. As the shapes of multiple medium sized cargo ships and escorts come into view, the Mosquitoes arm their bombs. The aircraft pass swiftly over the target dropping their anti-ship bombs with precision before the enemy crew can man their positions. The detonations strike all of the cargo ships and some of their escorts, slowly sending their crew and cargo to the bottom. The Mosquitoes bank away and begin their quick and daring journey home as enemy interceptors scramble at an airfield nearby. But the Mosquitoes and their crew do not fear and ready their heavy forward air-to-air armament.</p>

        <p class= "indenttext">A pair of Canadian CF-18 Hornets roar through the sky above the Gulf carrying a payload of 500lbs bombs. Coming up to the coast, they sight their target in the dusty hills. Though the visibility is low, the pilots' excellent navigational tools allow them to find their marks. They line up their bombsights and drop their munitions precisely on enemy artillery batteries below. The lead pilot looks behind their Hornet’s wingtip vortexes to see plumes of smoke rising from the hostile position. As they bank away they are painted by hostile aircraft radar. The RWR identifies the aircraft as Mig-21s. Luckily the CF-18s are equipped to handle the task. With the flick of a switch both CF-18s switch to Air-to-Air modes and open fire.</p>
        <p class= "indenttext">The DeHavilland Mosquito, the Wooden Wonder which would carry out some of the most daring and intricate sorties of WWII for the allied powers. Carrying bombs capable of extreme precision and destruction along with a powerful air to air armament to carry out combat air patrols. Though it may sound obvious the DeHavilland DH.98 Mosquito shares many of the same characteristics as modern multi-role aircraft and perhaps more interesting is that modern multi-role aircraft may have more in common with the Mosquito and other famous aircraft of the fighter and bomber varieties of WWII.</p>

        <p class= "indenttext">If you are less familiar with both the DH.98 Mosquito and the CF-18 (F-18) or other modern (late Cold War) multi-role aircraft, I recommend reading the following linked pages on these various aircraft (their capabilities, background, uses, etc.).</p>

        <h3 class= "subtitle"> // <br>The Mosquito's Relationship</h3>
        <p>Though many famous aircraft of WWII came chronologically before many aircraft which were mentioned in the “Modern Multi-role Aircraft Info Page”, one could argue that of them all, the DeHavilland Mosquito has the most in common with “Modern Multi-role Aircraft” or even the majority of modern military aircraft in general than some of the more famous birds of WWII (Spitfire, Lancaster, Mustang, etc.).</p>
        <p>Just like the Mosquito, many modern aircraft have the ability to reach relatively high speeds. Though perhaps slightly more common in modern times, in the 1940s the Mosquito was unique (also the fastest allied aircraft) and this allowed it to use its speed to outrun opponents and avoid danger. This, though was useful at the time, is a lot more useful now that weapon systems are way more powerful in the modern age. The old doctrine of heavy slow bombers using turrets to shoot down hostile aircraft and using their size to reduce damaging effect from flak is no longer viable as a SAM or AAM will be able to down most aircraft if it can catch up to it.</p>
        <p>Many modern military aircraft, both deemed “Multi-role” and not, have large carrying capacities. For Mosquito or Wooden Wonder as it was known, this consisted of a sizable bombay for ground or anti-ship bombs, points under the wings for more bombs or rockets and heavy forward multi-purpose machine guns. The Mosquito’s uniquely amazing ability to carry so much in a smaller airframe was due to its two powerful Merlin engines and terribly light wooden construction. In a more modern aircraft in the jet age, high carrying capacity means powerful engines and many hardpoints.</p>
        <p>Hardpoints deserve some special focus however, since they are the reason that almost any hardpoint equipped aircraft can become “Multi-role” even if not designed to be. Because the modern primary air-to-air weapon is the missile (which use hardpoints) and all air-to-ground weapons also use hardpoints (though they did in WWII as well), an aircraft such as the F/A-18 can quickly have missiles or bombs swapped out on the runway to carry out a different mission. Or be loaded up with HARMs for SEAD missions, Harpoons for Anti-Ship missions and a targeting pod with Maverick missiles.</p>
        <p>To conclude, the DeHavilland DH.98 Mosquito was both an incredible multi-role aircraft for its time (and also very beautiful) but it has inspired both design and combat doctrines of all modern military combat aircraft in one way or another. The Mosquito’s very similar characteristics to said modern aircraft really demonstrate this ancestry. Lastly, modern hardpoints are also extremely influential when it comes to the capabilities of modern aircraft and it is what allows them to be as adaptable and flexible as they are.</p>
