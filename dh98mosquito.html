        <p class= "indenttext">The DeHavilland DH.98 Mosquito was designed in 1938 by DeHavilland’s chief engineer, Geoffrey de Havilland. The aircraft was originally intended for use as a fast bomber alluding to a bomber doctrine which had floated about 1930s Europe of building light, unarmed bombers with extreme speed to evade and outrun interceptors instead of fighting them. However, the design was rejected by the British Air Ministry in favor of more traditional multi-turreted, heavily armed bombers (such as the Bristol Blenheim). But de Havilland persisted and funded the development of his design privately leading to its maiden flight on Nov 25th 1940.</p>

        <p class= "indenttext">Though originally designed as an unarmed fast bomber its size would have it first put to use by the RAF and Commonwealth Air Forces as a photo reconnaissance. However, the Mosquitos speed would redraw the attention of the Air Ministry and RAF who would eventually order it in many different variants and producing over 35 marks throughout its lifetime. Photo Reconnaissance (PR), Bomber (B), Fighter Bomber (FB), Night Fighter (NF) and Trainer (T) were the most common variants, however other unusual and practical prototypes were made as well. This allowed the Mosquito to carry out missions of every size, scope and precision. The fastest variants of the Mosquito could reach speeds up to 424 mph or 682 kph (NF.30) making them the fastest aircraft in the allied arsenal until 1944. The PR variants were equipped with 4 state of the art cameras around the nose while the B & FB variants had an internal bombay of 4,000lbs (along with the option of underwing mounts). The FB & NF variants were equipped with a very powerful forward armament of 4x 20mm Hispano cannons and 4x .303 British machine guns. Later marks of the NF variants also included a primitive radar and flash hiders for the guns. One prototype of note was also the “Sea Mosquito”, a Mosquito which had been modified for aircraft carrier use (foldable wings, torpedo carrying). These capabilities had Mosquitoes put to work in the majority of aircraft roles one could think of (of this time period) including: Pathfinding, Precision Bombing, Anti-Ship Warfare, ASW, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Combat Air Patrol*, VIP Transport, and much else. To conclude this short summary on the DeHavilland DH.98 Mosquito, it was a most impressive, advanced multi role aircraft of its time.</p>
        <p class= "indenttext">*Combat Air Patrol may not be a term used during the service time of the DH.98, however it was used here to convey similar meaning.</p>
